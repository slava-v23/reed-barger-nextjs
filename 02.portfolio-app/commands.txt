1. npm init -y
2. npm i next react react-dom
3. Create pages directory
4. Add in package.json 
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next"
  },
  This next script is running a webpack and babel setup. 
  The result of that is this .next folder. Inside here is all the javascript that we created, that will be compiled and bundled and 
  all the static assets like images or css files will be served from here, too.
5. Add inside pages our home page index.js.
  The pages folder is our routing system. 
  We don't need to import react in a componet.
  Next comes with Hot code reloading.

6. Port
  We can run our app on a diff port, that the default one 3000. In package.json:
  "dev": "next -p 4000"
